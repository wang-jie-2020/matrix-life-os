# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments`
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside this clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

If this is changed to `yes`, PRs should run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by wayfinder-style skills. The map is a single issue with child issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding notes, decisions so far, and open questions.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a sub-issue where GitHub supports it. Where sub-issues are not enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies where available. Where dependencies are not available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop blocked or assigned issues, and take the first available item in map order.
- **Claim**: assign the issue to the driving developer.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the issue, and update the map's decisions.
